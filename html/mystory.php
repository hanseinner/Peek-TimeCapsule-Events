               My life was always surrounded by events! My parents hosted an annual St George’s Feast in our home, where 
			   we often had a turnaround of 200+ guests every year. It was always fun. I enjoyed inviting my family, friends & strangers 
			   to celebrate the feast. I spent the lead up time preparing and talking about St George and why we celebrated the feast,
			   and it’s a story that never gets old. I was also followed by weddings through the different stages of my life.
				I was running around in wedding since I can remember. It started with been a flower girl a few times, I then carried the bride’s
				dress a few other times, and was a bridesmaid more than I should. The Chinese would call that a curse, but I call it a duty to make
				someone happy on a day they will always remember.

				The only thing I never liked is the camera, but I guess that’s part of the job. If you’re part of the bridal
				party, you’re followed by the camera. I’ve dreamed about opening my own events and tourism business since 2006. 
				I’ve built my connections in the industry, and it’s a grand, competitive one. Finally, I’m here and I’m ready. I’ve 
				walked the layouts and the designs of weddings from all walks of life: an Australian wedding, an Asian wedding, 
				a Muslim Arab wedding, an Indian wedding, an Egyptian wedding, an Eritrean wedding, to an East African wedding. 
				I can assure you, while they all celebrate the union of two souls, it’s important to be aware of the culture involved, 
				and sometimes it’s a fusion of many cultures.

               All these different weddings have one thing in common; confused brides who appreciated the direction. Most brides have a 
			   vision of what their wedding day should look like, but have no idea how to get there or the cost involved in getting there, 
			   not only the dollar value but the emotional and physical investment. They also don’t always have the cash to spend on a planner.  
				What I offer is something called ‘wedding consulting’, which means we help you plan your wedding, and we save you time and money. 
				You execute the plan yourself, but we have checkpoints to make sure you’re OK. We also have wedding directors who are happy to
				help you on the actual day of your wedding, because a bride can’t run the show and be the show at the same time. The wedding 
				directors look at your plan and bring it to life on the big day. We, of course, have the exclusive offer of taking care of the
				whole events from planning to even fruition

				Events don’t only mean weddings and engagements. That’s why I divide them into three different events: there are the 
				heart-to-heart events, the corporate, and the tourism events.  
				Tourism events are those occasions where people make memories that belong to a theme and to Queensland. I’ve been to 
				cities where I was hidden inside buildings, working from the sunrise till sunset, and I would fly back home and talk 
				about how much I hated the city. The truth is, I didn’t know the city. What I hated was staying in the same building 
				wishing my life away. I realised that bitter reality when, one day, I decided to visit the city ‘outside’ the office.

                I saw it, and it healed my heart that had bled every time I had landed in that city. Besides the buildings, 
				the traffic and the people who never smiled, I finally met people outside who smiled from ear to ear,
				there were beautiful buildings that invited you to come in and trams that roamed to places I didn’t know existed.
				Seeing the city changed my mood and transformed my perspective. I was actually motivated to work there, and I
				was far from counting the hours till my next flight. I had seen it from a local’s point of view. 
				That city wasn’t Brisbane, but I see colleagues who had boxed Brisbane into the boring work city, a place that steals their soul.
				And I want to tell them: Come with me, you can trust me, I’ve been to 26 cities in 4 different continents and Brisbane is the best.

                Yes, you could say I love traveling! It’s not the travel I’m drawn to. I’m naturally a more grounded person,
				but knowledge has always been my weakness. The experience of intertwining with a different wind in a different
				place that whispers a different story is what I chase. 
				I would like to visit each city again, but I never did. I have, however, always landed back home. I always came back to claim the
				 piece of me that I’d left behind. Home, Brisbane, has always been the most beautiful place I have ever seen, and not to be biased, 
				 but even the sun shines brighter here. This city has courted many hidden tales, and yet it remains pure and uncorrupted by the commercial world.
				 When you come here, I want you to take a peek through the eye of a local and truly appreciate a tour with us.
